# SpringFling
WLU Spring Fling.  A match making algorithm and platform. Once a year during Spring Term @WLU




# Frontend:
We can use either Solid.js or Svelte.js (SvelteKit).

## Data Science:
Load SQLite on the browser and then use D3.js to load into the browser. WASM accelerated code maybe? 

# Algorithm:
Maybe just python because it is probably easier. Golang would also be cool because it pretty fast and intuitive,
